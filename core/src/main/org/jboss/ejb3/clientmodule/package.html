		The client module is a deployment container which supports injection. All injected
		attributes are made available in JNDI under a context with the application client jndi name.
		This jndi name can be configured in META-INF/jboss-client.xml.
		The package forms a connector with the org.jboss.ejb3.client which runs in the client JVM.
