		This package provides the EJB Timer Service to the EJB3 stack.
		<p/>
		It replaces the org.jboss.ejb.txtimer package.
		<p/>
		The Jboss EJB3 Timer Service package depends on:
		<ul>
			<li>EJB3 API</li>
			<li>Quartz</li>
			<li>JTA</li>
		</ul>
		<p/>
		Note that almost all exceptions are caught and rethrown as EJBExceptions, thus
		making sure that no Quartz API is exposed either compile time or run time.
