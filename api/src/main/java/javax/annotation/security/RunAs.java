/**
 * The Bean Provider can use the RunAs metadata annotation or the Bean Provider
 * or Application Assembler can use the run-as deployment descriptor element to
 * define a run-as identity for an enterprise bean in the deployment descriptor.
 * The run-as identity applies to the enterprise bean as a whole, that is, to
 * all methods of the enterprise beanâ€™s business, home, component, web service
 * endpoint interfaces, to the message listener methods of a message-driven
 * bean, and to the timeout callback method of an enterprise bean, and all
 * internal methods of the bean that they might in turn call. The value is
 * the security role the bean runs as.
