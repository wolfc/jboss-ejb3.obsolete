<h2>Stateful Beans</h2>

It is also very easy to create a Stateful Bean with EJB 3.0 using deployment descriptors, as opposed to annotations.  Take a look at <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/stateful_deployment_descriptor/bean/ShoppingCartBean.java">ShoppingCartBean.java</a> and the corresponding deployment descriptors <a href="META-INF/ejb-jar.xml">ejb-jar.xml</a> and <a href="META-INF/jboss.xml">jboss.xml</a>
</p><p>
All bean types are homeless in EJB 3.0, so the <tt>home</tt> and <tt>local-home</tt> elements are not required. Only <tt>ejb-name</tt>, <tt>ejb-class</tt>, and <tt>session-type</tt> are required. The <tt>session-type</tt> element has the value <tt>Stateful</tt>.
</p><p>
ShoppingCartBean implements one interface. This is the remote interface of the EJB.  There is no local interface specified. Currently, you can only have one remote and/or local interface.
</p><p>
Take a look at <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/stateful_deployment_descriptor/bean/ShoppingCart.java">ShoppingCart.java</a>.  To define this as the remote interface of ShoppingCart bean
you only need the <tt>remote</tt> element.  
</p><p>
<h4>JNDI Bindings</h4>

The Calculator bean will have one JNDI bindings for the <tt>remote</tt> interface as specified in <a href="META-INF/ejb-jar.xml">jboss.xml</a> with the <tt>jndi-name</tt> element.
</p><p>
<h4>Client</h4>

Open up <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/stateful_deployment_descriptor/client/Client.java">Client.java</a>.  You'll see that it looks up the stateful bean under its remote interface's fully qualified classname.  Also notice that there is no Home interface and you can begin executing on the stateful bean right away.  When you access the bean in JNDI, an instance of the stateful bean will be created on the server.  So, when you need a different instance of the stateful bean, you do an additional <tt>jndi.lookup()</tt> to get this new reference.
</p><p>
<h4>Building and Running</h4>

To build and run the example, make sure you have <tt>ejb3.deployer</tt> installed in JBoss 4.0.x and have JBoss running.  See the reference manual on how to install EJB 3.0.  
<pre>
Unix:    $ export JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
Windows: $ set JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
$ ant
$ ant run

run:
run:
     [java] Buying 1 memory stick
     [java] 2004-10-06 19:37:16,869 INFO org.jboss.remoting.InvokerRegistry[main] - Failed to load soap remoting transpo

     [java] Checkout
     [java] Should throw an object not found exception by invoking on cart after @Remove method
     [java] Successfully caught no such object exception.
</pre>
</p><p>
The INFO message you can ignore.  It will be fixed in later releases of JBoss 4.0.
</p><p>
<h4>Jar structure</h4>

EJB 3.0 beans must be packaged in a JAR file with the suffix <tt>.ejb3</tt>.  Running the ant script above creates a JAR file within the deploy/ directory of JBoss.  All that needs to be in that jar is your server-side class files.  So basically just the ShoppingCartBean and the interfaces it implements.  JBoss will automatically browse the JAR file to determine if any EJBs are annotated by any classes within it.  THere is no precompilation step.
