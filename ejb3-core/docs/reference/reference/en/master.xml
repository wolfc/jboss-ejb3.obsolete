      <para>
        This isn't the only reference to learn EJB 3.0  Look in the JBoss EJB 3.0 tutorial
         for loads of example programs and detailed text describing each example.
      </para>

      <para>
         In some of the example listings, what is meant to be displayed on one line does not fit
         inside the available page width. These lines have been broken up. A '\' at the end of a
         line means that a break has been introduced to fit in the page, with the following lines
         indented. So:
         <programlisting>
   Let's pretend to have an extremely \
      long line that \
      does not fit
   This one is short
         </programlisting>
         Is really:
         <programlisting>
   Let's pretend to have an extremely long line that does not fit
   This one is short
         </programlisting>
      </para>
