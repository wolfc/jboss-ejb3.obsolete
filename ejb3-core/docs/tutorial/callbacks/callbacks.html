<h2>Callbacks and Callback Handlers</h2>

</p><p>
The EJB 3.0 specification defines some callbacks, and allows you to handle these by implementing your own callback handlers.
The callbacks defined for each bean are shown below:
</p><p>
<h3>Stateless session bean callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li> <tt>PostConstruct</tt> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.</li>
<li> <tt>PreDestroy</tt> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3>Message-driven bean callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li> <tt>PostConstruct</tt> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.</li>
<li> <tt>PreDestroy</tt> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3>Stateful session bean callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li> <tt>PostConstruct</tt> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.</li>
<li> <tt>PreDestroy</tt> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed. It will happen before any <tt>@Remove</tt> annotated method is invoked.</li>
<li> <tt>PostActivate</tt> - is invoked when</li>
<li> <tt>PrePassivate</tt> -</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3>Entity bean callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li> <tt>PrePersist</tt> - Is invoked right before the entity is created in the database. Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.</li>
<li> <tt>PostPersist</tt> - Is invoked right after the entity is created in the database. Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.</li>
<li> <tt>PreRemove</tt> - Is invoked right before the entity is deleted in the database. Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.</li>
<li> <tt>PostRemove</tt> - Is invoked right after the entity is deleted in the database. Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.</li>
<li> <tt>PreUpdate</tt> - Takes place right before the database is updated.</li>
<li> <tt>PostUpdate</tt> - Takes place immediately after the database has been updated.</li>
<li> <tt>PostLoad</tt> - Takes place right after data has been loaded from the database and associated with the entity</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The callbacks are not compulsory, and you can define the ones you want to handle.
</p><p>
<h3>Using callbacks on the bean class</h3>

You use the callbacks listed above by either annotating methods in the bean class. The annotations live in the <tt>javax.ejb</tt> package so for example <tt>PostConstruct</tt> would be <tt>javax.ejb.PostConstruct</tt>. You can call the methods what you like, but their method signature must return a void and take no arguments. Look at the <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/callback/bean/CustomerDAOBean.java">CustomerDAOBean</a> stateless session bean and you will see that the <tt>preDestroyCallback()</tt> method has been annotated with <tt>@javax.ejb.PreDestroy</tt>. For session/message-driven beans, just like for <a href="../interceptor/interceptor.html">Interceptors</a>, if the bean class extends another class any callback annotated methods  on the super class will be invoked first.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h3>Entity listeners for entity beans</h3>

You can also separate out the callbacks for entity beans into a separate EntityListener class. Take a look at the <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/callback/bean/Customer.java">Customer</a> entity bean, and you will see that the class has been annotated with
<pre>@javax.persistence.EntityListener("org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerCallbackListener")</pre> This specifies that the <tt>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerCallbackListener</tt> class should be used as the callback listener class for the bean. Now open <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/callback/bean/CustomerCallbackListener.java">CustomerCallbackListener</a> and you will see that the class annotates the callback methods in the same way as when defining callbacks on the bean class itself. However, one <b>important difference</b> is that callback methods defined in a listener class must take a single argument, which will be the bean we are working with. The parameter must be of type <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>, or the actual bean type.
</p><p>
<h3>Interceptors for session/message-driven beans</h3>

Callbacks for session beans can also be put into a separate class, configured as an interceptor <a href="../interceptor/interceptor.html">Interceptors</a>. This means that your interceptors can initialise themselves when constructed. The lifecycle methods in an interceptor must have the following signature:
</p><p>
<pre>
   Object &lt;any method name&gt;(InvocationContext)
</pre>
</p><p>
<a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/callback/bean/CustomerDAOBean.java">CustomerDAOBean</a> specifies that it wants to use an external interceptor.
<pre>
@Stateless
@Remote(CustomerDAO.class)
@Interceptors({LifecycleInterceptor.class})
public class CustomerDAOBean implements CustomerDAO
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
and <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/callback/bean/LifecycleInterceptor.java">LifecycleInterceptor</a> has a <tt>@PostConstruct</tt> annotated method. As shown, each interceptor lifecycle method must call <tt>proceed</tt> on the InvocationContext to invoke the next interceptor. 
</p><p>
Interceptors may contain both the <tt>@AroundInvoke</tt> methods for intercepting business methods, and lifecycle methods. If you want to configure lifecycle methods for your interceptors with xml, you will need to do this in the <tt>interceptor</tt> section of ejb-jar.xml, and the keywords are <tt>post-construct-method</tt>, <tt>post-activate-method</tt>, <tt>pre-passivate-method</tt> and <tt>pre-destry-method</tt>. For example
</p><p>
<pre>
&lt;ejb-jar&gt;
   &lt;interceptors&gt;
      &lt;interceptor&gt;
         &lt;interceptor-class&gt;org.acme.SomeInterceptor&lt;/interceptor-class&gt;
         &lt;around-invoke-method&gt;
            &lt;method-name&gt;interceptorMethod&lt;/method-name&gt;
         &lt;/around-invoke-method&gt;
         &lt;post-construct-method&gt;
            &lt;method-name&gt;sendCancelMessage&lt;/method-name&gt;
         &lt;/post-construct-method&gt;
         &lt;pre-destroy-method&gt;
            &lt;method-name&gt;sendCancelMessage&lt;/method-name&gt;
         &lt;/pre-destroy-method&gt;
      &lt;/interceptor&gt;   
   &lt;/interceptors&gt;
&lt;/ejb-jar&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Interceptor methods for handling lifecycle events follow exactly the same ordering and inheritance rules as business method interceptor methods, and an interceptor instance follows the lifecycle of the bean instance it is bound to.
</p><p>
<h4>Building and Running</h4>

To build and run the example, make sure you have <tt>ejb3.deployer</tt> installed in JBoss 4.0.x and have JBoss running.  See the reference manual on how to install EJB 3.0.
<pre>
Unix:    $ export JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
Windows: $ set JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
$ ant
$ ant run

run:
     [java] Create Bill Burke and Monica Smith
     [java] log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.jboss.remoting.Client).
     [java] log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
     [java] Bill and Monica get married
     [java] Get all the Burkes
     [java] There are now 2 Burkes
     [java] Bill and Monica are moving abroad
</pre>
</p><p>
In the jboss console window you should see:
<pre>

20:06:05,596 INFO  [STDOUT] PostConstruct - Have EntityManager: true

20:06:05,697 INFO  [STDOUT] doPostRemove: Deleted Customer: Monica Burke
</pre>
</p><p>
Now if you open up JBOSS_HOME/server/all/deploy/ejb3.deployer/META-INF/hibernate.properties and add the following line
</p><p>
<pre>
hibernate.show_sql=true
</pre>
</p><p>
and restart JBoss before running the example again, the output should be:

</pre>
</p><p>
Thus you can see how the callbacks on the entity bean wrap the interaction with the database.
