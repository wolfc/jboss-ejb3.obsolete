<h2>Dependency Injection</h2>

To facilitate test driven development, the EJB 3.0 specification allows you to use annotations to inject dependencies through annotations on fields or setter methods.  Instead of complicated XML ejb-refs or resource refs, you can use the <tt>@EJB</tt> and <tt>@Resource</tt> annotations to set the value of a field or to call a setter method within your session bean with anything registered within JNDI.  You can use the <tt>@EJB</tt> annotation to inject EJB references and <tt>@Resource</tt> to access datasources.
</p><p>
Open up <a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/injection/bean/ShoppingCartBean.java">ShoppingCartBean.java</a>.  ShoppingCartBean uses the Calculator stateless session EJB to do calculations.  The example shows two ways to get access to the Calculator EJB.  One is:
</p><p>
<pre>
   @EJB
   private Calculator calculator;
</pre>
</p><p>
When the ShoppingCartBean instance is created, the EJB container will set the calculator field using the jndiName of that particular referenced EJB.
</p><p>
You are not limited to injecting dependencies on fields.  You can also use @EJB on a setter method.  The below example from ShoppingCartBean uses the <tt>@EJB</tt> annotation to inject the reference to the Calculator session bean:
</p><p>
<pre>
   private Calculator set;

   @EJB(beanName="org.jboss.tutorial.injection.bean.CalculatorBean")
   public void setCalculator(Calculator c)
   {
      set = c;
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
The @javax.annotation.Resource annotation allows you to inject resources.
</p><p>
<pre>

   @Resource(mappedName="DefaultDS")
   private javax.sql.DataSource ds;
</pre>
</p><p>
In JBoss, whenever the mappedName() attribute is specified (@Resource, @EJB), jboss will use that as the GLOBAL jndi name to look it up.
</p><p>
The @Resource annotation is used to inject these singletons as well.
<pre>
   @Resource javax.ejb.SessionContext ctx;
   @Resource javax.ejb.TimerService timer;
   @Resource javax.ejb.UserTransaction ut;
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt>@EJB</tt> and <tt>@Resource</tt> also create an entry within the JNDI ENC of the bean.  So, the above @EJB injection will create an entry for the reference calculator bean under "java:comp.ejb3/env/ejb/calculator".
Note, the ENC name <i>SHOULD</i> be "java:/comp/env", but the JBoss Application server is currently being refactored in this
area, so an EJB3 specific namespace is being used.
   
<h4>Building and Running</h4>

To build and run the example, make sure you have <tt>ejb3.deployer</tt> installed in JBoss 4.0.x and have JBoss running.  See the reference manual on how to install EJB 3.0.  
<pre>
Unix:    $ export JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
Windows: $ set JBOSS_HOME=&lt;where your jboss 4.0 distribution is&gt;
$ ant
$ ant run

run:
run:
     [java] Buying 1 memory stick

     [java] Print cart:

     [java] Checkout
</pre>
</p><p>
The INFO message you can ignore.  It will be fixed in later releases of JBoss 4.0.
</p><p>
<h4>Jar structure</h4>

EJB 3.0 beans must be packaged in a JAR file with the suffix <tt>.jar</tt>.  Running the ant script above creates a JAR file within the deploy/ directory of JBoss.  All that needs to be in that jar is your server-side class files.  So basically just the ShoppingCartBean and the interfaces it implements.  JBoss will automatically browse the JAR file to determine if any EJBs are annotated by any classes within it.  THere is no precompilation step.
