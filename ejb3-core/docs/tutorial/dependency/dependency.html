<h2>Dependency</h2>

Dependencies of an EJB on a service or services, including other EJBs, may be specified through the &lt;depends&gt; tag of the jboss.xml deployment descriptor. The &lt;depends&gt;
tag is analagous to the Depends annotation. The dependencies control the deployment of EJBs such that an EJB will not deploy until all of it's dependencies have successfully
deployed. 
</p><p>
<h4>jboss-service.xml</h4>

Take a look at <a href="META-INF/jboss-service.xml">jboss-service.xml</a>. This service deployment descriptor starts a service based on
<a href="src/org/jboss/tutorial/dependency/bean/DependedOn.java">DependedOn.java</a>.
</p><p>
<h4>jboss.xml</h4>

Take a look at <a href="META-INF/jboss.xml">jboss.xml</a>. This deployment descriptor indicates that the <tt>HasXmlMBeanDependencyBean</tt> is dependent on the
<tt>jboss.test:service=DependedOn</tt> started by <tt>jboss-service.xml</tt>. The <tt>HasXmlMBeanDependencyBean</tt> will not deploy until the <tt>jboss.test:service=DependedOn</tt> 
service has successfully started.
</p><p>
<h4>Building and Running</h4>

To build and run the example, make sure you have <tt>ejb3.deployer</tt> installed in JBoss 4.0.x and have JBoss running.  See the reference manual on how to install EJB 3.0.
The run ant task will deploy just the <tt>HasXmlMBeanDependencyBean</tt> EJB. You will see deployment dependency log entries in the JBoss console and the following client
exception as the bean has not been deployed due to the unfullfilled dependency.
