!!!Message Drive Beans
This example shows you how to implement an MDB with EJB 3.0.


You configure properties by using the @MessageDriven(activationConfig) attribute with a bunch
of @ActivationConfigProperty.  All properties that you can set are defined in this file.  Internally
this is the class that is created to hold config information.

[MDBConfig.java|http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jboss/jboss-ejb3/src/main/org/jboss/ejb3/mdb/MDBConfig.java?rev=1.1&view=markup]

Take a look at [ExampleMDB.java|src/org/jboss/tutorial/mdb/bean/ExampleMDB.java].

The [queue-example-service.xml|queue-example-service.xml] file defines the queue.  This is the same in regular JBoss.

!Building and Running
To build and run the example, make sure you have {{ejb3.deployer}} installed in JBoss 4.0.x and have JBoss running.  See the reference manual on how to install EJB 3.0.  
{{{
Unix:    $ export JBOSS_HOME=<where your jboss 4.0 distribution is>
Windows: $ set JBOSS_HOME=<where your jboss 4.0 distribution is>
$ ant
$ ant run

}}}

Look in the console window to determine that the message was sent.
