		<h3>EJB 3 Interceptors</h3>
		<h4>Level 1: Instrumented</h4>
		This creates instrumented classes. Any call to an instrumented class
		is intercepted. This includes calls which a bean makes to itself.
		<h4>Level 2: Container instrumentation</h4>
		With container instrumentation the user had to maintain control
		of how objects are constructed and invoked. All invocations going
		through the container are intercepted. 
		<h5>Direct container</h5>
		Call an object through the container 'directly'.
		<h5>Proxy container</h5>
		Call an object through a proxy which directs it to the container.
		<h4>Level 3: Indirect container instrumentation</h4>
