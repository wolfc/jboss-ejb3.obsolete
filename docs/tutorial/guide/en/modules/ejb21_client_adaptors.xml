	<title>Introduction to using EJB2.1 client adaptors with EJB3</title>

	<para>
		EJB 3.0 is backward compatible to EJB 2.x clients and supports the use of local and remote home interfaces as well as
		initialization methods (e.g. ejbCreate()). This capability is configured through annotations and/or through deployment
		descriptors.
	</para>

	<para>
		Take a look at <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.ejb21_client_adaptors.bean.Session1Bean</literal>. Note
		that the class is annotated with <literal>@RemoteHome</literal> and the <literal>ejbCreate()</literal> method is annotated
		with <literal>@Init</literal>. The former annotation indicates that the bean provides a EJB 2.1 style home interface. The latter
		annotation indicates that when the <literal>create()</literal> method is invoked from the home interface, the bean is initialized
		via the <literal>ejbCreate</literal> method.
		<note>
			<para>
				The initialization method (annotated with <literal>@Init</literal>) name is not restricted to be ejbCreate(). You can
				specify any other name for that method.
			</para>
		</note>

	</para>

	<para>
		<literal>org.jboss.tutorial.ejb21_client_adaptors.bean.Session2Bean</literal> illustrates the use of a local home interface.
	</para>

	<note>
			<para>
				There's a very important difference between the <literal>remote</literal> and a <literal>business-remote</literal>
				interface. The EJB2.x remote interfaces, which extend from EJBObject, are referred through the <literal>&lt;remote&gt;</literal>
				tag in the ejb-jar.xml. On the other hand, the EJB3 style Plain Old Java Interface which is implemented by your EJB3 style
				POJO bean is known as the business-remote interface and is represented by the <literal>@Remote</literal> and it's
				corresponding <literal>&lt;business-remote&gt;</literal> tag in ejb-jar.xml.

				Similar is the case with <literal>&lt;local&gt;</literal> and the <literal>&lt;business-local&gt;</literal> tags in ejb-jar.xml.
			</para>

			<para>
				In this tutorial, you will notice that we are using <literal>remote</literal> and <literal>local</literal> interfaces and
				not <literal>business-remote</literal> and <literal>business-local</literal> interfaces.
			</para>
	</note>

	<note>
		<para>
			Since we are not using any <literal>business-remote</literal> or <literal>business-local</literal> interfaces, in this tutorial,
			unlike the "jndibinding" tutorial, we cannot use the <literal>@RemoteBinding</literal> or <literal>@LocalBinding</literal>
			annotations to bind the EJBs. Instead, we configure the jndi-names for these beans through the <literal>META-INF/jboss.xml</literal>:

			<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
<session>
	<ejb-name>Session1</ejb-name>
	<jndi-name>Session1Remote</jndi-name>
</session>
<session>
	<ejb-name>Session2</ejb-name>
	<local-jndi-name>Session2Local</local-jndi-name>
</session>

				]]>
			</programlisting>
		</para>
	</note>

	<para>
		Similarly, <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.ejb21_client_adaptors.bean.DeploymentDescriptorSession1Bean</literal> and
		<literal>org.jboss.tutorial.ejb21_client_adaptors.DeploymentDescriptorSession2Bean</literal> mimic the behavior of
		the first two beans, but use deployment descriptors to indicate the home interface(s) and initialization method(s).
		Take a look at the <literal>META-INF/ejb-jar.xml</literal>. Note the <literal>home</literal> and <literal>local-home</literal>
		tags that indicate the respective home interfaces. Also, note the <literal>init-method</literal> tag that indicates the
		initialization method(s) executed when beans are created via the home interface(s).
