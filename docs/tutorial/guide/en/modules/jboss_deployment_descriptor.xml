	<title>Usage of JBoss specific deployment descriptors</title>

	<para>
		The EJB 3.0 specification supports the usage of deployment descriptors to describe ejb metadata
		or override most metadata described via annotations. The jboss.xml deployment descriptor describes
		JBoss specific metadata, including remote and local JNDI names, cluster configuration, a security domain,
		additional references, security principal, and container configuration. Annotations which define the ejb
		(e.g. <literal>@Stateful</literal>, <literal>@Remote</literal>) cannot be overridden.

		jboss.xml :

		<para>
			Take a look at <literal>META-INF/jboss.xml</literal>.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					The <literal>jndi-name</literal> element defines the remote JNDI binding for the <literal>ShoppingCartBean</literal> stateful session bean.
					This JNDI binding overrides the default binding or a binding specified through the <literal>@RemoteBinding</literal> annotation.
					Similarly, the <literal>local-jndi-name</literal> element specifies the local JNDI binding.
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					The <literal>clustered</literal> element indicates that the ejb is clustered, with <literal>partition-name</literal> and
					<literal>load-balance-policy</literal> specifying the cluster name and load balance policy, respectively.
					These elements will override the parameters specified in the <literal>@Clustered</literal> annotation.
					In this example, you will see that the <literal>ShoppingCartBean</literal> ejb is clustered.
					<note>
						If you build and run this example with the "default" server configuration, the deployment will
						fail, as the default server configuration does not support clustering. You will have to run this
						example on the "all" server configuration which supports clustering
					</note>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					The <literal>security-domain</literal> element specifies a security domain for the ejb, overriding
					any security domain set through the <literal>@SecurityDomain</literal> annotation. In this example,
					you will see that a security domain is set through the jboss.xml deployment descriptor and unless a
					Principal and Credential (i.e. user/password) is set in the client, requests to the ejb will fail
					with a javax.ejb.EJBAccessException.

					<note>
						The jboss.xml shows using the security-domain at a bean level as well at the entire deployment level.
						Each bean can have its own security-domain and will override the one set at the deployment level.

Building and Running
	<para>
			<note>
					<para>
						To build and run the example, make sure you have installed JBoss 5.x.
						See the <xref linkend="JBossAS5">installation section</xref> for details.
					</para>
