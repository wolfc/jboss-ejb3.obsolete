	<title>Introduction to Secondary tables for EJB3 entities</title>
	<para>
		The EJB specification allows you to map an entity bean to multiple tables. You do this by using the <literal>@SecondaryTable</literal>
		annotation.
	</para>
	<para>
		The <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.secondary.bean.Customer</literal> entity maps its address properties to a
		separate ADDRESS table. The first thing it does is define the secondary table.
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
@Entity
@Table(name = "CUSTOMER")
@SecondaryTable(name = "EMBEDDED_ADDRESS", join = {@JoinColumn(name = "ADDRESS_ID")})
public class Customer implements java.io.Serializable
{
}
			]]>
		</programlisting>
		The <literal>@JoinColumn</literal> of the secondary table must match the value of the Customer's primary key. To map
		individual properties to a secondary table you use the <literal>secondaryTable</literal> member value of <literal>@Column</literal>.
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
@Column(name = "STREET", secondaryTable = "EMBEDDED_ADDRESS")
public String getStreet()
{
   return street;
}

			]]>
		</programlisting>

			View the tables and rows:

		<para>
			You can view the tables created by JBoss by going to the
			<ulink url="http://localhost:8080/jmx-console/HtmlAdaptor?action=inspectMBean&amp;name=jboss%3Aservice%3DHypersonic%2Cdatabase%3DlocalDB">Hypersonic Service</ulink>,
			scrolling down to the <literal>startDatabaseManager</literal> button and clicking it.
			A Hypersonic SQL window will be minimized, but you can open it up to look at the tables and do queries.
