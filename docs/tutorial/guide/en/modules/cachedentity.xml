		This tutorial shows you how to cache your entities using EJB 3.0 for JBoss

	</para>
	<sect5>
		Caching primer :

		<para>
			To avoid roundtrips to the database, you can use a cache for your entities.
			JBoss EJB3 uses Hibernate as the JPA implementation which has support for a second-level cache.
			The Hibernate setup used for our JBoss EJB 3.0 implementation uses JBossCache as its underlying cache
			implementation. With caching enabled:

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					If you persist an entity (that has caching enabled) to the database via the entity manager
					the entity will also be added to the cache. Subsequent requests to fetch the entity, with
					this id, will be retrieved from cache and thus will save a database trip.
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					If you update an entity (that has caching enabled) and save the changes to the database via
					the entity manager the entity will also be updated in the cache.
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					If you remove an entity (that has caching enabled) from the database via the entity manager
					the entity will also be removed from the cache.
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			JBossCache allows you to specify timeouts to cached entities. Entities not accessed within a certain
			amount of time are dropped from the cache in order to save memory.
		</para>

		<para>
			Furthermore, JBossCache supports clustering. If running within a cluster, and the cache is updated,
			changes to the entries in one node will be replicated to the corresponding entries in the other nodes
			in the cluster.
		</para>
	</sect5>

	<sect5>
		Enabling caching and choosing cache :
		<para>
			Take a look at <literal>META-INF/persistence.xml</literal> which sets up the caching for this deployment:
			<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
<property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache" value="true"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache" value="true"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class" value="org.hibernate.cache.jbc2.JndiMultiplexedJBossCacheRegionFactory"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.jbc2.cachefactory" value="java:CacheManager"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.jbc2.cfg.entity" value="mvcc-entity"/>
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.jbc2.cfg.query" value="local-query"/>
<property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/>
				]]>
			</programlisting>
			<note>
				These properties in the persistence.xml enabling caching and also configure JBossCache as the Cache manager.
				For more details about JBossCache and its configurations, have a look at the JBossCache project documentation.
			</note>

			<note>
				We have intentionally set the <literal>hibernate.show_sql</literal> property in the persistence.xml to true.
				When this property is set, Hibernate will print to STDOUT the sql queries that are fired to the database, when
				the entity is being operated upon. This will, later on, help us in verifying whether the entity is being picked up
				from cache or is being loaded from database through a SQL query.
			</note>
		</para>
	</sect5>

	<sect5>
		Entities:

		<para>
			You define your entities <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.cachedentity.bean.Customer</literal> and <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.cachedentity.bean.Contact</literal> the normal way.
			The default behaviour is to not cache anything, even with the settings shown above, in the persistence.xml.
			A very simplified rule of thumb is that you will typically want to do caching for objects that rarely change,
			and which are frequently read. We also annotate the classes with the <literal>@Cache</literal> annotation to
			indicate that the entities should be cached.
			<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
@Entity
@Cache (usage=CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
public class Customer implements java.io.Serializable
{
...
				]]>
			</programlisting>

			<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[
@Entity
@Cache (usage=CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
public class Contact implements Serializable
{
...

				]]>
			</programlisting>
			This defines that the Customer and the Contact entities need to be cached. Any attempt to look up
			<literal>Customer</literal> or <literal>Contact</literal> by their primary key, will first attempt
			to read the entry from the cache. If it cannot be found it will try and load it up from the database.
		</para>

		<para>
			You can also cache relationship collections. Any attempt to access the <literal>contacts</literal> collection of
			<literal>Customer</literal> will attempt to load the data from the cache before hitting the database:
			<programlisting>
				<![CDATA[

@Entity
@Cache (usage=CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
public class Customer implements java.io.Serializable
{
...

   @Cache (usage=CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
   @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer", fetch=FetchType.EAGER, cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
   public Set<Contact> getContacts()
   {
      return contacts;
   }
...
}
				]]>

			</programlisting>

		</para>
	</sect5>

	<sect5>
		Client :
		<para>
			Open <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.cachedentity.client.CachedEntityRun</literal>. It takes two arguments, they are the
			server:jndiport of the two nodes to use. If you look at the 'run' target of <literal>META-INF/build.xml</literal>
			you will see that they both default to localhost:1099, so in this case node1 and node2 will be the same,
			i.e. no clustering takes place.
		</para>

Building and Running
	<para>
			<note>
					<para>
						To build and run the example, make sure you have installed JBoss 5.x.
						See the <xref linkend="JBossAS5">installation section</xref> for details.
					</para>
			</note>
			From the command prompt, move to the "cachedentity" folder under the <xref linkend="EJB3_TUTORIAL_HOME">EJB3_TUTORIAL_HOME</xref>
			<sect5>
		Ant Users:
			</sect5>
				<para>
				Make sure the "all" server configuration of JBossAS-5.x is running
				</para>
			<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
$ ant
$ ant run

run:
     [java] Saving customer to node1 = localhost:1099
     [java] Looking for customer on node2 = localhost:1099 (should be available in cache)
     [java] Found customer on node2 (cache). Customer details follow:
     [java] Customer: id=1; name=JBoss
     [java]     Contact: id=2; name=Kabir
     [java]     Contact: id=1; name=Bill

	<para>
		On the server you will notice these logs:
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
02:14:04,528 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: insert into Customer (id, name) values (null, ?)
02:14:04,529 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: call identity()
02:14:04,542 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: insert into Contact (id, CUST_ID, name, tlf) values (null, ?, ?, ?)
02:14:04,543 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: call identity()
02:14:04,544 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: insert into Contact (id, CUST_ID, name, tlf) values (null, ?, ?, ?)
02:14:04,545 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: call identity()

02:14:04,634 INFO  [EntityTestBean] Find customer with id = 1
02:14:04,645 INFO  [STDOUT] Hibernate: select customer0_.id as id0_1_, customer0_.name as name0_1_, contacts1_.CUST_ID as CUST4_3_, contacts1_.id as id3_, contacts1_.id as id1_0_, contacts1_.CUST_ID as CUST4_1_0_, contacts1_.name as name1_0_, contacts1_.tlf as tlf1_0_ from Customer customer0_ left outer join Contact contacts1_ on customer0_.id=contacts1_.CUST_ID where customer0_.id=?
02:14:04,682 INFO  [EntityTestBean] Customer with id = 1 found
02:14:04,756 INFO  [EntityTestBean] Find customer with id = 1
02:14:04,801 INFO  [EntityTestBean] Customer with id = 1 found

			]]>

		</programlisting>
		As you can see, the first time the customer with id = 1 was being requested through the entity manager, a database query was fired to
		fetch it, since it was not available in cache. The Customer object was then loaded from the database and stored in the cache. As can be
		seen in the next request to fetch the customer with the same id. This request to the entity manager, pulls up the entity from the cache
		instead of firing a database query.
