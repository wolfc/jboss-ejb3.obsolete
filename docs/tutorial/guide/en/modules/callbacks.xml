	<title>Introduction to Callbacks and Callback Handlers in EJB3</title>

		The EJB 3.0 specification defines some callbacks, and allows you to handle these by implementing your own callback handlers.
		The callbacks defined for each bean are shown below:
		<itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Stateless session bean callbacks
					<itemizedlist mark="hyphen">
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostConstruct</literal> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PreDestroy</literal> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed.
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					Message-driven bean callbacks
					<itemizedlist mark="hyphen">
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostConstruct</literal> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PreDestroy</literal> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed.
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					Stateful session bean callbacks
					<itemizedlist mark="hyphen">
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostConstruct</literal> - is invoked when the bean is first created, after any dependency injection is done.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PreDestroy</literal> - is invoked when the bean is removed from the pool or destroyed.
								It will happen before any <literal>@Remove</literal> annotated method is invoked.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostActivate</literal>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PrePassivate</literal>
						</listitem>

					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<para>
					Entity bean callbacks
					<itemizedlist mark="hyphen">
						<listitem>
								<literal>PrePersist</literal> - Is invoked right before the entity is created in the database.
								Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostPersist</literal> - Is invoked right after the entity is created in the database.
								Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PreRemove</literal> - Is invoked right before the entity is deleted in the database.
								Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostRemove</literal> - Is invoked right after the entity is deleted in the database.
								Will cascade to all entities to which this operation is cascaded.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PreUpdate</literal> - Takes place right before the database is updated.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostUpdate</literal> - Takes place immediately after the database has been updated.
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
								<literal>PostLoad</literal> - Takes place right after data has been loaded
								from the database and associated with the entity
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					The callbacks are not compulsory, and you can define the ones you want to handle.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<sect5>
			Using callbacks on the bean class:
		</sect5>
		<para>
			You use the callbacks listed above by annotating methods in the bean class.
			The annotations live in the <literal>javax.ejb</literal> package so for example <literal>PostConstruct</literal>
			would be <literal>javax.ejb.PostConstruct</literal>. You can call the methods what you like, but their method signature
			must return a void and take no arguments. Look at the <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerDAOBean</literal>
			stateless session bean and you will see that the <literal>preDestroyCallback()</literal> method has been annotated with
			<literal>@javax.ejb.PreDestroy</literal>. For session/message-driven beans, just like for interceptors, if the bean class
			extends another class any callback annotated methods on the super class will be invoked first.
		</para>

		<sect5>
			Entity listeners for entity beans:
		</sect5>
		<para>
			You can also separate out the callbacks for entity beans into a separate EntityListener class. Take a look at the
			<literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.Customer</literal> entity bean, and you will see that the class has been annotated with
			<literal>@javax.persistence.EntityListener("org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerCallbackListener")</literal>.
			This specifies that the <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerCallbackListener</literal> class should be used as
			the callback listener class for the bean. Now open <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerCalbackListener</literal>
			and you will see that the class annotates the callback methods in the same way as when defining callbacks on the bean class itself.
			However, one __important difference__ is that callback methods defined in a listener class must take a single argument, which will
			be the bean we are working with. The parameter must be of type <literal>java.lang.Object</literal>, or the actual bean type.
		</para>

		<sect5>
			Interceptors for session/message-driven beans:
		</sect5>
		<para>
			Callbacks for session beans can also be put into a separate class, configured as an interceptor.
			This means that your interceptors can initialise themselves when constructed. The lifecycle methods in an interceptor
			must have the following signature:

			<programlisting><![CDATA[Object <any method name>(InvocationContext)]]></programlisting>
			<literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.CustomerDAOBean</literal> specifies that it wants to use an external interceptor.
			<programlisting>
@Stateless
@Remote(CustomerDAO.class)
@Interceptors({LifecycleInterceptor.class})
public class CustomerDAOBean implements CustomerDAO
{
   ...
}
			</programlisting>

			and <literal>org.jboss.tutorial.callback.bean.LifecycleInterceptor</literal> has a <literal>@PostConstruct</literal> annotated method.
			As shown, each interceptor lifecycle method must call <literal>proceed</literal> on the InvocationContext to invoke
			the next interceptor. Interceptors may contain both the <literal>@AroundInvoke</literal> methods for intercepting
			business methods, and lifecycle methods. If you want to configure lifecycle methods for your interceptors with xml,
			you will need to do this in the <literal>interceptor</literal> section of ejb-jar.xml, and the keywords are
			<literal>post-construct-method</literal>, <literal>post-activate-method</literal>, <literal>pre-passivate-method</literal>
			and <literal>pre-destry-method</literal>. For example:

			<programlisting><![CDATA[
<ejb-jar>
   <interceptors>
      <interceptor>
         <interceptor-class>org.acme.SomeInterceptor</interceptor-class>
         <around-invoke-method>
            <method-name>interceptorMethod</method-name>
         </around-invoke-method>
         <post-construct-method>
            <method-name>sendCancelMessage</method-name>
         </post-construct-method>
         <pre-destroy-method>
            <method-name>sendCancelMessage</method-name>
         </pre-destroy-method>
      </interceptor>
   </interceptors>
</ejb-jar>]]>

			</programlisting>

			Interceptor methods for handling lifecycle events follow exactly the same ordering and inheritance rules as business method
			interceptor methods, and an interceptor instance follows the lifecycle of the bean instance it is bound to.

	Now if you open up the persistence.xml, in this tutorial, and uncomment the following:
