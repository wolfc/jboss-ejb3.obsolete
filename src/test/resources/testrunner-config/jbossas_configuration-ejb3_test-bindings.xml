  JBoss EJB3 TestSuite AS Configuration/Test Bindings
  
  This file defines bindings between EJB3 Integration Tests
  and the AS Server Configurations in which they must run, 
  representing a N:N relationship.
  
  The grammar takes form:
  
  <bindings>
    <configurations>
      <configuration name="uniqueName">
        <tests>
          <test name="example1" />
          <test name="example1" />
          <test name="example1" />
        </tests>
      </configuration>
    </configurations>
  </bindings>
