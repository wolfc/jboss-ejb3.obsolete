   // Important implementation note : The order of the class field initialization
   // (i.e. static fields) is important. This "stamp" field needs to be initialized
   // *before* the static "singleton" field. Note: The order of execution is guaranteed
   // to be the same as the order in which the static fields appear as per the spec
   // http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/classes.doc.html#39245
   // Section 8.7 : The static initializers and class variable initializers are executed in textual order.
   //
   // If singleton is declared before "stamp" then it will cause the following bug
   //
   // public static final IsLocalProxyFactoryInterceptor singleton = new IsLocalProxyFactoryInterceptor();
   // private static final long stamp = System.currentTimeMillis();
   // private long marshalledStamp = stamp;
   //
   // 1) Default class initialization occurs and all static fields including "stamp" are set to default values
   // 2) So at this point stamp = 0
   // 3) Then class field intializer blocks are executed. Since "singleton" field intialization comes
   //   before "stamp" field initialization, the new IsLocalProxyFactotyInterceptor gets called.
   //   This results in object field initialization where the "marshalledStamp" is first set to
   //   default value of 0 and then the object field initializer is called. The object field initializer
   //   then sets the "marshalledStamp" to the value of "stamp" which is 0 (as per #2) because the static field
   //   initializer for "stamp" has not yet executed.
   // 4) So ultimately "marshalledStamp" will hold 0.
   // 5) After the class field intializer block for "singleton" field completes, it moves onto class field
   //   initialization of "stamp" and sets the value of "stamp" to the current system time (=xxxxx)
   // 6) So ultimately after this complete initialization process, the values of marshalledStamp = 0
   //   and that of stamp = xxxx
   // 7) At a later point of time when isLocal() compares these 2 values(through stamp == marshalledStamp) it always returns
   //   false and hence all calls are considered remote.
   //
   // So the rule is - declare class field "stamp" before the class field "singleton"
